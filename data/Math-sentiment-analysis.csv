This also means\nthat a majority of the StoreUnivariate interface is now implemented in Univariate to provide\ndeligates when storage is active. and to throw runtime exceptions when its not (this at least until\nwe establish rolling implementations for those methods).

Also modify the build to include an \"Implementation-Vendor-Id\" of \"org.apache\" in the jar's manifest.\nThe two non-standard entires created in the manifest file will look something like the following:\nX-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.3\nX-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.3\nThis change serves two purposes:\n1) To provide comfort to users regarding JVM compatibility.\n2) Enable releases to be checked more easily for JVM compatibility.\nThe manifest specification indicates that \"unknown\" entries in the manifest file are ignored. These entries have been prefixed with \"X-\" which is a sometimes used \"convention\" for indicating non-standard entries.\nSee thread: http://tinyurl.com/839zh,project.properties,0.20833333333333334,0.5083333333333333,False
